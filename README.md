## Project Objective
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance, we need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This solution will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.
## Data Set Used

## KPIâ€™s Requirements
Number of Patients:
-
Measure the total number of patients visiting the ER daily.
Display a daily trend using an area sparkline to understand patterns over time, such as peak days or seasonal trends.

Average Wait Time:
-
Calculate the average time patients wait before being attended to by a medical professional.
Use an area sparkline to show daily fluctuations and identify days with higher wait times that may require operational adjustments.

Patient Satisfaction Score:
-
Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis to evaluate the quality of service provided.
Present a daily trend using an area sparkline to identify dips in satisfaction and correlate them with operational challenges or peak times.

Number of Patients Referred:
- 
Count the number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER each day.
Use an area sparkline to track daily trends and identify departments with high referral rates, which may require additional resources.
